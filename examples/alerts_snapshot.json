Multiple waves of precipitation will move\nthrough the region while this cold air mass is in place, bringing\nmultiple opportunities for low elevation snow. This will be a long\nduration event, and after the initial front Monday night,\nprecipitation will become more showery, resulting in periods of\nspotty and quick accumulations. The values reflected  below indicate\ntotals over a 72 hour period from 10pm Monday through 10pm Thursday.\nDaytime heating will result in snow levels rising to around\n2000-2500 ft during the daylight hours, then lower back down during\nthe overnight periods. The best chances for accumulating snow down\nto valley floors will be during the overnight and early morning\nhours.\n\n* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations 2 to 6 inches, with\n6 to 10 inches expected across the Modoc, along Highway 97 north\nof Chiloquin and the higher terrain of the Warners.
